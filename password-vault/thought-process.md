The other document is more like something I would present and share with the team if I were working on this project. However, as this is an interview, I decided to also create and share this document where I lay down my thought process as I am working on the problem.

1. **What has already been done before?**
   - Articles on how to build a password manager – as a project
   - Already existing tools
     - Found some open source options
     - Used AI to understand the codebase and how it works

2. **Research reinforced prior knowledge** – I knew this already, but doing further research emphasized how complicated and difficult password managers can be. It's kinda irresponsible to build a password manager from scratch. Instead I decided to go down the path of evaluating existing open source options and building operational hardening around them to fulfil the requirements.

3. **Requirements** – Now that I have a general sense of the landscape, I essentially have the functional and non-functional requirements.

4. **Evaluation framework** – Now that I know what I'm looking for, I have an evaluation metric and can compare options.

5. **Compare options** – List out all options and then evaluate them.

6. **Pick one.**

7. **Adapt to our use case** – Figure out how to adapt it to our use case.

8. **Make a proof of concept.**
